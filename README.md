This repositary contains a Genetic programming library that was built as a 
final project for MSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham.

In order to use the library Genetic package in the src directory has to be
into the application of choice.

User guide on how to use the library is available in the project report.

All of the runanble classes in the pacman directory showcase how the library
works and how you can set it up yourself.

The results of some of the best runs are recorded into separate text files
contained in the results directory and can be run using the runnable classes
in the pacman directory.
